<h1>ASP.Net Core</h1>

<p>ASP.NET Core is the new web framework from Microsoft. ASP.NET Core is the framework you want to use for web development with .NET. At the end this tutorial, you will have everything you need to start using ASP.NET Core and write an application that can create, edit, and view data from a database.</p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC Tutorial</p>
<p>The MVC (Model-View-Controller) is an application development pattern or design pattern which separates an application into three main components:

Model: Model is a part of the application which implements the logic for the data domain of the application. It is used to retrieve and store model state in a database such as SQL Server database. It also used for business logic separation from the data in the application.<br>

View: View is a component that forms the application's user interface. It is uses to create web pages for the application. An example would be an edit view of a Products table that displays text boxes, drop-down lists and check boxes based on the current state of a Product object.<br>

Controller: Controller is the component which handles user interaction. It works with the model and selects the view to render the web page. In an MVC application, the view only displays information whereas the controller handles and responds to the user input and requests.</p>

<h1>MERN STACK</h1>

<p>MERN is an acronym for the four technologies that form the stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. js. Developers recognize the MERN stack as a simplified development platform for building highly scalable and interactive web applications.</p>


<h1>DBMS</h1>

<p>MS SQL Server</p>
<p>A programming language that allows users to store, update, search, and retrieve data in a relational database. SQL is used to manage databases and query the data they contain.</p>

<p>MongoDB</p>
<p>MongoDB is a non-relational document database that provides support for JSON-like storage. The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.</p>

<h1>Web Technology</h1>
<p>Web Technology refers to the various tools and techniques that are utilized in the process of communication between different types of devices over the Internet. A web browser is used to access web pages. Web browsers can be defined as programs that display text, data, pictures, animation, and video on the Internet. Hyperlinked resources on the World Wide Web can be accessed using software interfaces provided by Web browsers.</p>

<h1>Data Struture</h1>
<p>Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming. They define how data is organized, stored, and manipulated within a program. Understanding data structures is very important for developing efficient and effective algorithms.

In this tutorial, we will explore the most commonly used data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.</p>

<h1>Java</h1>
<p>Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages which is used to develop mobile apps, desktop apps, web apps, web servers, games, and enterprise-level systems. Java was invented by James Gosling and Oracle currently owns it. JDK 23 is the latest version of Java.

Popular platforms like LinkedIn, Amazon, and Netflix rely on Java for their back-end architecture, showcasing its stability and scalability across different environments. Its popularity is so high that 3 Billion+ devices use Java across the world.</p>
